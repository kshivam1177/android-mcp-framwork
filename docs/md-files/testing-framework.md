# Natural-language testing framework: Native Android + Flutter

## Product goal

Provide a change-aware testing lifecycle that reads a repository, maintains human-readable test knowledge, converts natural-language requests into explicit plans, reuses existing tests, and writes auditable reports. The shared intelligence/reporting layer supports Native Android and Flutter.

## Reuse instead of reinventing

- Use Google's Android CLI for supported Android capabilities, including Android Studio integration and Journeys where available.
- Reuse Gradle, Android unit/instrumentation tests, Flutter test and integration-test commands, and established project conventions.
- Add adapters only for gaps not covered by existing tools. Detect capabilities rather than assuming each command exists.

## Intended lifecycle

1. Discover platforms, modules, existing tests, instructions and repository state.
2. Analyze the Git diff and map changed files to affected features and dependencies.
3. Combine the diff, saved testing knowledge and the natural-language request into a proposed test plan.
4. Reuse existing tests first; propose generated tests/journeys for uncovered behavior.
5. Validate assertions and preconditions before execution. Require explicit execution opt-in before running project-native tests.
6. Execute through Google Android CLI, Gradle, Flutter tooling or supported automation adapters.
7. Capture structured outcomes, logs, screenshots and environment details. Distinguish pass, fail, blocked, skipped and inconclusive.
8. Propose instruction updates based on verified changes; do not silently replace user-authored instructions.
9. Save immutable run reports under .androidmcp-framework/test-reports/YYYY-MM-DD/HHmmss/.

## On-disk layout

All project-local framework data is rooted at .androidmcp-framework/:

- config.yaml — framework settings
- instructions/ — user-authored and reviewed testing instructions
- testcases/ — saved structured test-case JSON
- generated-tests/ — review-required candidate JSON; not executable by default
- test-reports/ — immutable timestamped reports, summaries, JUnit XML, command logs, and evidence indexes
- artifacts/screenshots/ — captured screenshot images
- artifacts/ui-snapshots/ — captured semantic UI hierarchy JSON
- artifacts/recordings/ — emulator/device screen recordings
- artifacts/bugreports/ — adb bugreport ZIP archives
- knowledge/ — test knowledge and inventory

The screenshot, snapshot_ui, record_emulator_video, and bug_report tools save outputs to the matching artifacts subdirectory by default. File names are timestamped to avoid replacing earlier evidence. The repository's .gitignore ignores .androidmcp-framework/ by default, so evidence and reports remain local unless a project owner intentionally changes that policy.

## Implemented capabilities

- analyze_test_project: read-only Native Android/Flutter scan and Git change summary.
- save_test_instructions: stores Markdown instructions without overwriting unless explicitly authorized.
- save_test_case: stores structured test-case JSON with overwrite protection.
- write_test_report: writes Markdown and JSON reports, without inferring success from missing results.
- analyze_changes: maps Git changes to targeted test suites and recommends broad regression when impact is uncertain.
- resolve_test_instructions: combines global, project, feature, and run-specific instructions with deterministic precedence.
- validate_test_plan: blocks incomplete or malformed test plans before execution.
- audit_screen and analyze_screenshot: inspect visible UI nodes and optional local OCR results.
- fill_form and run_ui_workflow: execute reusable selector-based form and JSON screen/action workflows through supported Android automation.
- run_test_workflow: plans and optionally executes saved test cases with per-step assertions and reports.
- validate_test_environment: read-only preflight for project markers, saved cases, ADB and target readiness.
- consolidate_test_reports: creates Markdown, JSON, and JUnit XML summaries; missing outcomes are not treated as passing.
- run_project_tests: previews or executes framework-selected Flutter and Native Android project-native test suites, with bounded logs and reports.
- aggregate_test_evidence: creates a JSON/Markdown evidence index across reports, including missing artifact references.
- generate_test_candidate: creates non-executable, review-required candidate JSON from explicit acceptance criteria and optional proposed UI actions from a coding agent.
- evaluate_test_gate: evaluates consolidated report status under a strict CI gate policy.

See [Testing Framework Phases 11–15](../testing-framework-phases-11-15.md) for usage and the Native Android/Flutter validation matrix. See Declarative UI workflows and Screenshot OCR for existing UI workflow formats and limitations.

## Test execution safety

- run_project_tests defaults to plan-only mode. Set execute=true only after reviewing the project root and selected suite.
- Only framework-defined Flutter and Gradle test tasks are run. Arbitrary shell commands and arbitrary model-generated command strings are not accepted.
- Flutter integration tests and native connected instrumentation tests require a selected, ready device.
- A test candidate is not executable until a human reviews and converts its placeholder steps into verified interactions and selectors.
- evaluate_test_gate rejects empty reports, explicit failures, and skipped/incomplete results by default. CI must fail the job when its decision is not pass.
- Report output is bounded and secrets are redacted in the structured report. Inspect command logs before sharing them externally.
- Do not delete or overwrite user tests silently.
- Build success does not prove behavioral correctness; assertions must map to stated requirements.
- Report environment failures separately from product failures.
- No real emulator/device end-to-end validation is claimed until the documented sample matrix has actually been executed and its results recorded.
